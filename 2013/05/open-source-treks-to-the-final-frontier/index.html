          <p>There have <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/leonp/2013/05/08/here-comes-linux/">been</a> a <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/hussaino/2013/05/15/linux-dominating-space/">couple</a> of blog posts recently referencing the recent switch <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> made from Windows to <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian 6</a>, a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU/Linux</a> distribution, as the OS running on the laptops aboard the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html">International Space Station</a>. It’s worth noting that Linux is no stranger to the ISS, as it has been a part of ground control operations <a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/w3/issue/12/Linux_on_the_International_Space_Station.pdf%20">since the beginning</a>.</p>
          
          <p>The reasons for the space-side switch <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/to-the-space-station-and-beyond-with-linux-7000014958/">are quoted</a> as</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>…we needed an operating system that was stable and reliable – one
          that would give us in-house control. So if we needed to patch,
          adjust, or adapt, we could.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>This is satisfying to many Open Source/Linux fans in its own right: a
          collaborative open source project has
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">once again</a> proved itself more
          stable and reliable for the (relatively) extraordinary conditions of low
          Earth orbit than a product produced by a major software giant. Plus
          one for open source collaboration and peer networks!</p>
          
          <!-- more -->
          
          <p>But there’s another reason to be excited. And it’s a reason that would
          not necessarily apply
          (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XTHdcmjenI#t=9m08s">mostly</a>) to,
          say, Apple fanatics had NASA decided to switch to OS X instead of
          Debian. And that reason has to do with the collaborative nature of the
          open source movement, codified in many open source licenses under
          which the software is released. Linux, and the GNU tools, which
          together make up a fully functional operating system, are released
          under the
          <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>. Unlike
          many licenses used for commercial software, the GPL ensures that
          software licenses under its terms remains free for users to use,modify
          and redistribute. There are certainly some strong criticisms and
          <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/roumen/entry/sun_s_criticism_of_gpl">ongoing debate</a>
          regarding some key aspects of the GPL, especially
          <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19133/Torvalds_Still_Will_Not_License_Linux_Under_GPL_v3/">version 3</a>,
          the point of contention mostly lies in what is popularly called the
          “viral” effect of the license: that modified and derived work must
          also be released under the same license. The GPL might not be
          appropriate for every developer and every project, but it embodies the
          spirit of open source software in a way that is agreeable with many
          developers and users.</p>
          
          <p>So what does this all mean in terms of NASA’s move? We already know
          that they chose GNU/Linux for its reliability and stability over
          alternatives, but that doesn’t mean it’s completely bug free, or will
          always work perfectly with every piece of hardware, which after all is
          another reason for the switch: no OS will be completely bug free or
          always work with all hardware, but at least Debian gives NASA the
          flexibility of making improvements themselves. And there in lies the
          reason for excitement. While there is no requirement that NASA
          redistribute their own modified versions of the software, there is no
          reason to assume they wouldn’t in most cases, and if they do, it will
          be redistributed under the same license. It’s certainly realistic to
          expect they will be directing a lot of attention to making the Linux
          kernel, and the GNU tools packaged with Debian even more stable and
          more reliable, and those improvements will make their way back into
          the general distributions that we all use. This means better hardware
          support for all GNU/Linux users in the future!</p>
          
          <p>And of course it works both ways. Any bug fixes you make and
          redistribute may make their way back to the ISS, transforming
          humanity’s thirst for exploring “the final frontier” into a truly
          collaborative and global endeavor.</p>
