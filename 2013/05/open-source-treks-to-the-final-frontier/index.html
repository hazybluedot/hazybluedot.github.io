            </div>
            <p>There have <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/leonp/2013/05/08/here-comes-linux/">been</a> a <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/hussaino/2013/05/15/linux-dominating-space/">couple</a> of blog posts recently referencing the recent switch <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> made from Windows to <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian 6</a>, a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU/Linux</a> distribution, as the OS running on the laptops abord the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html">International Space Station</a>. It’s worth noting that Linux is no stranger to the ISS, as it has been a part of ground control operations <a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/w3/issue/12/Linux_on_the_International_Space_Station.pdf%20">since the beginning</a>.</p>
            
            <p>The reasons for the space-side switch <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/to-the-space-station-and-beyond-with-linux-7000014958/">are quoted</a> as</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>…we needed an operating system that was stable and reliable – one
            that would give us in-house control. So if we needed to patch,
            adjust, or adapt, we could.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This is satisfying to many Open Source/Linux fans in its own right: a
            collaborative open source project has
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">once again</a> proved itself more
            stable and reliable for the (relatively) extrodinary conditions of low
            Earth orbit than a product produced by a major software giant. Plus
            one for open source collaboration and peer networks!</p>
            
            <p>But there’s another reason to be excited. And it’s a reason that would
            not necessarily apply
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XTHdcmjenI#t=9m08s">mostly</a>) to,
            say, Apple fanatics had NASA decided to switch to OS X instead of
            Debian. And that reason has to do with the collaborative nature of the
            open source movement, codified in many open source licenses under
            which the software is released. Linux, and the GNU tools, which
            together make up a fully functional operating system, are released
            under the
            <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>. Unlike
            many licenses used for commersial software, the GPL esures that
            software licenses under its terms remains free for users to use,modify
            and redistribute. There are certainly some strong criticisms and
            <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/roumen/entry/sun_s_criticism_of_gpl">ongoing debate</a>
            regarding some key aspects of the GPL, especially
            <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19133/Torvalds_Still_Will_Not_License_Linux_Under_GPL_v3/">version 3</a>,
            the point of contention mostly lies in what is popularly called the
            “viral” effect of the license: that modified and derived work must
            also be released under the same license. The GPL might not be
            appropriate for every developer and every project, but it embodies the
            spirit of open source software in a way that is agreeable with many
            developers and users.</p>
            
            <p>So what does this all mean in terms of NASA’s move? We already know
            that they chose GNU/Linux for its reliability and stability over
            alternatives, but that doesn’t mean it’s completely bug free, or will
            always work perfectly with every piece of hardware, which after all is
            another reason for the switch: no OS will be completely bug free or
            always work with all hardware, but at least Debian gives NASA the
            flexibility of making improvements themselves. And there in lies the
            reason for excitement. While there is no requirement that NASA
            redistribute their own modified versions of the software, there is no
            reason to assume they wouldn’t in most cases, and if they do, it will
            be redistributed under the same license. It’s certainly realistic to
            expect they will be directing a lot of attention to making the Linux
            kernel, and the GNU tools packaged with Debian even more stable and
            more reliable, and those improvements will make their way back into
            the general distributions that we all use. This means better hardware
            support for all GNU/Linux users in the future!</p>
            
            <p>And of course it works both ways. Any bug fixes you make and
            redistribute may make their way back to the ISS, transforming
            humanity’s thirst for exploring “the final frontier” into a truly
            collaborative and global endeavor.</p>
