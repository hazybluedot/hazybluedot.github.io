            <p>How to go about creating a space that facilitates learning? As we
          learned from Morningstar and Farmer, there is a danger of
          over-designing the space and often the users don’t end up using the
          space in the way the designer intended. So we shouldn’t
          over-design. But there should probably be some kind of structure,
          right? Or why create the space at all? <cite>my brain</cite></p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>These are some of the thoughts that were going through my head as I
          set out to plan my final project. Throughout the semester a common
          focus of mine has been the lack of a space in my own field (Electrical
          &amp; Computer Engineering) to facilitate making connections between the
          work that goes on in the department, both teaching and research, and
          the outside world.</p>
          
          <!-- more -->
          
          <p>I also became interested in many of the ideas Ivan Illich presented in
          <a href="http://deschoolingsociety.digress.it/learning-webs/">chapter 6</a> of
          “<a href="http://deschoolingsociety.digress.it/">Descooling
          Society</a>”. Specifically, how
          would we go about creating a network to facilitate skill exchange and
          peer matching? Once we have a peer-to-peer network of learners, what
          role does an “elder” have, and how does one become an elder?</p>
          
          <p>I began by looking at some exiting peer networks and online
          communities that I have had either direct or indirect involvement in
          to see how they addressed the questions of structure, but in the space
          itself, and any imposed structure between peers that imposes some sort
          of hierarchy, or the notion of an “elder”.</p>
          
          <h3 id="the-linux-kernel">The Linux Kernel</h3>
          
          <p>It has been several decades since Linus Torvalds’ <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!msg/comp.os.minix/dlNtH7RRrGA/SwRavCzVE7gJ">original announcement</a> of his new operating system:</p>
          
          <pre class="text"><code> From: torvalds@klaava.Helsinki.FI (Linus Benedict Torvalds) &#x000A;Newsgroups: comp.os.minix &#x000A;Subject: What would you like to see most in minix? &#x000A;Summary: small poll for my new operating system &#x000A;Date: 25 Aug 91 20:57:08 GMT &#x000A;Organization: University of Helsinki &#x000A;&#x000A;Hello everybody out there using minix - &#x000A;&#x000A;I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and&#x000A;professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing&#x000A;since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on&#x000A;things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat&#x000A;(same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons)&#x000A;among other things).&#x000A;&#x000A;</code></pre>
          
          <p>since that time the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Linux kernel</a> project
          has grown to be the largest collaborative endeavor in the history of
          computing. According to one measure, there were 1,316 developers
          involved with the version 3.2 release, each contributing an average of
          10,935 lines of code to the project. The clip found on the
          linxfoundation’s website summarizes how this tremendous feat is
          possible:</p>
          
          <p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="584" height="329" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yVpbFMhOAwE?t=1m43s%20" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
          <p>There is a fairly simple and effective hierarchy in place: individual
          developers submit patches to senior kernel developer who in turn
          review and sign off on patches before sending onward to Linus Torvalds
          for final approval. This is the most dictatorship-like model of any of
          the networks I looked at, but I think it makes a lot of sense. The
          stability and usefulness of the Linux kernel depends on all 15 million
          lines of code working well with one another, a more ad-hoc “allow
          everyone to contribute, fix errors later” method such as the one
          embodied by <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">wikipedia</a> probably wouldn’t be
          effective for this project. It’s worth noting that the rather strict
          structure doesn’t prevent people from maintaining and contributing to
          forks of the kernel other than the one maintained by Torvalds. In
          fact, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/android-and-linux-re-merge-into-one-operating-system/10625">up until
          recently</a>,
          <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/linus-torvalds-on-android-the-linux-fork/9426">Google maintained its own
          fork</a>
          of the kernel for it’s Android operating system.</p>
          
          <h3 id="githubcom">github.com</h3>
          
          <p>The versioning control tool git was created by the Linux development
          community in response to changes in the relationship between the open
          source community and the company responsible for BitKeeper, the
          versioning control system used up until 2005, much like they would on
          other social networking sites, but rather than posts about current
          gastronomic adventures, GitHub generates feeds of updates and changes
          made to various software projects.</p>
          
          <p>There isn’t really a notion of a uniform social hierarchy, as everyone
          is the maintainer of their own project, and may act as contributor to
          any other project. Individual projects may be <a href="https://github.com/explore">“trending” or
          “featured”</a> depending on activity.</p>
          
          <h3 id="stackoverflowcom">stackoverflow.com</h3>
          
          <p>Still on the geek theme, stackoverflow is an invaluable resource to
          many software developers, novice or advanced. Organized into a
          question and answer format, anyone can post a question or an answer
          and the site <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/about">provides tools</a> to
          improve the quality of questions and up-vote helpful answers. There is
          a notion of currency, called “reputation”, that members earn through
          participating on the site. Gaining reputation can unlock certain
          <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/privileges">privileges</a> that are not
          available to all users. With enough reputation, individuals can be
          elevated to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users?tab=moderators">moderator</a>
          status, a role I would associate with Illich’s notion of an “elder”.</p>
          
          <h3 id="couchsurfingorg">couchsurfing.org</h3>
          
          <p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="584" height="329" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Lr_VNUTvOeQ%20" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
          <p>Up until this point the sites I’ve surveyed have been what we would
          generally refer to “virtual” spaces. The communities and interactions
          exist primarily in
          cyberspace. <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org">Couchsurfing</a> is a bit
          different. At its core it is a network of travelers who open their
          homes to other travelers to provide a uniquely personal and rewarding
          experience not available from hotels or other travel industry
          offerings. It is focused on helping people explore the world by
          connecting with other people in a particular geographic area, remote
          or local, so many of the interactions take place in the “real”
          world. However, a thriving virtual community is also an integral part
          of the couchsurfing experience in the form of discussion forums
          organized into groups of free formed topics ranging from <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/n/places/blacksburg-virginia-united-states">geographic
          areas</a>,
          to helping each other <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/group.html?gid=21491">learn new
          languages</a>, to
          <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/group.html?gid=592">everything</a><a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/group.html?gid=2080">in</a><a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/group.html?gid=1302">between</a>.</p>
          
          <p>One of the first questions asked by couch surfing skeptics is “is it
          safe”? There seems to be a common fear among those who do not
          couchsurf that most strangers are creeps who would sooner steal your
          wallet than let you stay for free on their couch. While most of those
          who join couchsurfing do so because they naturally have a more
          optimistic view of humanity, safety is <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/n/help">a high
          priority</a> and a clear set of
          <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/n/guidelines">community guidelines</a> are
          published to help ensure everyone has a safe, enjoyable experience.</p>
          
          <p>Most importantly though, is the system of references in place that
          enable members to rate the experience they had with other
          members. References themselves do not directly lead to any increased
          privileges in the community: members are free to use the information
          as they see fit. Some opt to only host or otherwise connect with
          people who have received a lot of positive references while others
          will accept hosts or guests with few or no references. I have never
          come across a profile with negative references. I suspect that this is
          not because there are no negative experiences (in fact I have heard of
          a couple from witnesses), but that people with negative references
          don’t last long in the community. While there are many people who
          would help those new members who do not have any references yet, I
          think few would choose to welcome someone who has violated the spirit
          of couchsurfing in some way.</p>
          
          <p>Separate but related to the reference system is the
          <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/vouch.html">vouching</a> system. This is a
          more formalized approach to building trust networks and is a more
          integral part of the structure of the site in that being vouched for
          can grant certain privileges, namely, the ability to vouch for
          others. Unlike references, vouching is intended to ONLY apply to
          people who have met face-to-face, though the enforcement of that rule
          is left to the community itself.</p>
          
          <h3 id="illichvillichnet">illichvillich.net</h3>
          
          <p>The greatest challenge I have faced in the creation of a space for
          learning has been to identify which aspects of the previously
          mentioned successful virtual communities should be integrated, and
          how. At its core, the inspiration came from my understanding of the
          role <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~ece/student_projects/coffee/">english coffee
          houses</a> played in
          the 17th and 18th century. While the idea of gathering around a
          particular beverage was not unknown at the time, the precursor to
          coffee was ale and along with the switch from a depressant to a
          stimulant also came a marked change in the intellectual culture
          surrounding these popular gather spots. People from all walks of life
          were able to mingle and share ideas and the space became an
          intellectual breeding ground separate, but connected with the
          universities of the time. I can only imagine that without any set
          curriculum the topics of discussion varied greatly with the interest
          of the participants and the local events of the time.</p>
          
          <p>It goes without saying then (and yet, here I am, saying it), that
          topics must be defined and controlled by the members. But I don’t want
          to create yet another forum site.</p>
          
          <p>Of the <a href="http://deschoolingsociety.digress.it/learning-webs/#24">four
          networks</a>
          defined by Illich to enable his vision of a deschooled society:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Reference Services to Educational Objects</li>
            <li>Skill Exchanges</li>
            <li>Peer-Matching</li>
            <li>Reference Services to Educators-at-Large</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>I was most interested in building a Skill Exchange and Peer-Matching
          network. I feel that if I can create a space that is successful in
          that goal, the two “Reference Services” networks should follow
          organically, as it seems the primary challenge there is collecting the
          information, there are already well defined implementations of
          “reference services”.</p>
          
          <p>On the face of it, implementing a skill exchange and peer-matching
          network is just a matter of defining a data structure that can
          associate a set of skills with a particular individual and then an
          algorithm that will match people who have mutual skill-learning
          interests. That’s the easy part. The challenge, which was brought up
          during the final presentation day, is that most people are probably
          not going to want to spend any amount of time entering individual
          skills and interests they have and those they want to learn. Ideally
          all a user would need to provide are links to existing blogging and
          micro-blogging feeds, in which case we would need an algorithm that
          would parse content that is already being created by each user to
          determine skill sets and interests. This is the challenge, and a
          complete lexicographic analysis is well beyond my current knowledge of
          algorithm design. What would be relatively straight forward is
          grabbing tags from existing structured feeds that provide that
          information. It would still depend on self-reporting, but ideally
          self-reporting that is already being done anyway.</p>
          
          <p>The real challenge has been to figure out what more to do. What I have
          mentioned so far would be useful, but not particularly unique. In
          fact, couchsurfing already has a notion of “Learn, Teach, Share” built
          into the profiles, though the system doesn’t really facilitate
          searching for people based on that information. The more I have talked
          with Illich enthusiasts, the more it becomes clear that the real
          potential lies in creating more of a platform for exploring ideas,
          rather than just a repository of information. The last brainstorming
          session I had quickly turned from the details of setting up a skill
          exchange network to the much more difficult questions of</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>how is a unit of information stored?</li>
            <li>who decides what a unit of information is?</li>
            <li>how are individual units of information connected with one another?</li>
            <li>how does a user effectively navigate a space of interconnected units of information?</li>
            <li>how does a user track their personal path through a network of information nodes?</li>
            <li>how does a user share their path through a network of information nodes?</li>
            <li>who writes the information nodes?</li>
            <li>should nodes have structural support for quizzes/practice exercises to help learners decide if they have mastered a particular topic well enough to move on to another?</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>And then implementation details involved with all of those are of
          course somewhat overwhelming at this point.</p>
          
          <p>I plan to have another brainstorming session tonight, with a different
          group of hackers and see were these ideas lead. In the mean time, I
          will continue to get a working implementation of a basic
          skill-matching network up at
          <a href="http://www.illichvillich.net/">illichvillich.net</a>, just as soon as
          I’m finished posting final grades.</p>
