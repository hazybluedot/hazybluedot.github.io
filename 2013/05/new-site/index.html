          <h2 id="goodbye-wordpress">Goodbye Wordpress</h2>
          
          <p>For the past two years I have been using Virginia Tech’s
          <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/">Blogs@VT</a> service to host my blog. It’s
          been nice and all, but my goal had always been to move away from the
          VT hosted option and away from <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>
          too. It’s not that I don’t appreciate all that Blogs@VT or WordPress
          has done: I think Blogs@VT is an excellent service providing
          easy-access blog hosting to the Virginia Tech community (though they
          really should fix whatever is making
          <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/support/2012/11/27/faq-i-cant-access-or-feed-out-my-posts-by-category/">this hack</a>
          necessary to get tag feeds), and WordPress is fine for what it does,
          but there were a few things that bugged me, mostly relating to the…</p>
          
          <!-- more -->
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>UI and work-flow. As a WordPress blogger I was pretty much forced to
          use the WordPress interface for entering content, which is kind of
          crummy if you want to do anything other than add elements that had
          buttons associated with them.  The text mode interface is almost not
          worth the effort, as it seems to allow HTML tags, but does some
          extra parsing that makes it a pain to copy and paste HTML generated
          elsewhere: WordPress seems to replace empty lines with <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> tags,
          which is incredibly annoying when the code you’re pasting in has
          been hard-wrapped to 80 columns. Either be a straight forward HTML
          pass through, OR assume some kind of well established markup syntax
          such as <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>speed. WordPress is a dynamic site generator. The actual data for
          the posts is stored in a database somewhere and HTML pages are
          created on the fly when a visitor requests a particular
          resource. This isn’t a major issue with today’s internet and
          computer speeds, but for something like a simple blog that serves up
          mostly static content WordPress can feel sluggish at
          times. Especially, I found, when syndicating a lot of feeds, such as
          on a <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/ece2524s13">mother blog</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>code syntax highlighting and equations. Yes, there are WordPress
          plugins to handle both of these things, but each seem to have their
          own non-standard syntax making it difficult to switch between
          different engines. Furthermore, the themeing of WordPress makes it
          harder than it should be to style code blocks without having to muck
          around with the CSS for the rest of the site. While Blogs@VT is
          excellent at responding to plugin-install requests, there is still a
          non-zero turn around time, making it difficult to try a number of
          solutions before settling on a final one.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>lack of versioning/backup. I was at the mercy of blogs@vt as far as
          backups were concerned, and versioning control is pretty dismal with
          the WordPress interface.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2 id="hello-nanoc">Hello Nanoc</h2>
          
          <p><a href="http://nanoc.ws">Nanoc</a> is one of roughly
          <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/02/list-static-website-generators.html">32 bazillion static site generators</a>. A
          static site generator works a lot like the software behind a dynamic
          site, like WordPress, but instead of doing the transformation of data
          to HTML pages on the fly on the server, all the work is done locally
          on your own machine. What gets sent to the server is a set of HTML and
          CSS files that make up a complete site.</p>
          
          <p>Nanoc happens to be written in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, a
          language I am not terribly familiar with, but want to learn, one
          reasons I choose Nanoc over some of the other options. Jekyll is
          another popular Ruby-based static-site generator. It seems to be
          primarily aimed at generating blog sites, and is very good at what it
          does. While this is certainly a blog, I am also interest in creating
          less blog-specific websites, and so the more general-site approach
          used by Nanoc (but with some handy dandy
          <a href="http://nanoc.ws/docs/api/Nanoc/Helpers/Blogging.html">blogging helper modules</a>)
          was more appealing for my long term goals.</p>
          
          <h2 id="static-is-better-for-me">Static is Better (for me)</h2>
          
          <p>I can use the same work-flow I use for most other text files. I create
          content mostly in Markdown using Emacs. This makes it super easy to
          include things like source code blocks and equations, things that were
          always a bit tricky in WordPress. Since everything is stored as text
          files I can use <a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a> for version control and because the generated
          content is just a bunch of static files I can use the awesomely free
          <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to host my site.</p>
          
          <p>I have more control. There are a ton of decent themes for WordPress,
          but tweaking to get things the way you want can be a pain. The
          stylesheets tend to be big and complex, and finding just the right
          place to change can be difficult when you don’t know what you’re
          looking for and there seem to be 10 times the necessary structural
          elements.</p>
          
          <h2 id="static-has-challenges">Static has Challenges</h2>
          
          <p>As I mentioned, <em>most</em> content on a blog is static, and so it makes
          sense to serve it up as static pages. As with all things in life,
          there are some exceptions, notably commenting systems. The real-time
          comments you see on WordPress and the like are dynamic features and
          implementing these with a static site generator can be a challenge. I
          had originally planned on going with a popular 3rd party service
          Disqus, but after reading
          <a href="http://www.jeremyscheff.com/2011/08/jekyll-and-other-static-site-generators-are-currently-harmful-to-the-free-open-source-software-movement/">a strong argument</a>
          against Disqus on grounds of it not being open source I wavered. I’m
          not sure how much of an open source fundamentalist I want to be
          yet. Generally I’d like to adopt a more pragmatic philosophy and use
          non-free-as-in-speech software if it gets the job done better than
          free alternatives. But comments are a little special, because there’s
          the other issue of data privacy. Of course, the comments themselves
          will be made public, but there are other pieces of data associated
          with a comment, such as email and IP addresses, that would warrant a
          good read of Disqus’s (or whatever other social commenting service I’d
          consider)
          <a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy">privacy policy</a>
          before jumping in head first.</p>
          
          <p>It turns out that there <em>is</em> an open-source alternative called
          <a href="https://github.com/phusion/juvia">juvia</a>. I haven’t taken too much of
          a look at it but it seems to have all the important bits in
          place. Since it is just the code, I’d have to set up my own server to
          run the service itself, so integrating the comments with my static
          blog would be similar to the process with Disqus and make use of some
          JavaScript magic.</p>
          
          <p>The simplicity of a
          <a href="http://tlvince.com/static-commenting">static commenting solution</a> has
          its draw. It seems the most elegant approach, if I can just get a good
          workflow. Matt Palmer
          <a href="http://hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/2011/07/19/static-comments-in-jekyll.html">has developed</a>
          <a href="http://theshed.hezmatt.org/jekyll-static-comments/">a plugin</a> for
          <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> to handle static comments,
          I suspect it could be easily modified to work with nanoc.</p>
          
          <h2 id="trackbacks-vs-referrals">Trackbacks vs. Referrals</h2>
          
          <p><a href="http://webtrainingwheels.com/what-are-pingbacks-and-trackbacks-and-how-do-i-use-them/">Trackbacks and Pingbacks</a>
          are protocols to help connect blog posts that refer to each other. The
          rely on special software running on a server responding in real-time
          to requests and as such are dynamic features. I have not read up
          enough on either protocol to determine how or if I want to implement in
          on this site. I did come across <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2003/06/take_your_trackbacks_and_dangle.htmlq">a relatively old post</a> making the
          argument that given the majority use of Trackback it is unnecessary and
          duplicates the functionality already gained by referrals. There is of
          course <a href="http://www.onfocus.com/2003/06/32182">a rebuttal</a>, so I am still not sure what to do. One way or
          another, it would be nice to generate a list of posts/pages/resources
          that link back to individual articles here.</p>
