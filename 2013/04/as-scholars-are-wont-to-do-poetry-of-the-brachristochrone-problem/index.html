            <p>Time is an important dimension to consider when tracing the path of a
            media-represented concept. This is a theme that has stuck with me
            since reading Brenda Laurel’s “The Six Elements and Causal Relations
            Among Them” and coming across this brilliant bit of prose:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>As scholars are wont to do, I will blame the vagaries of
            translation, figurative language, and mutations introduced by
            centuries of interpretation for this apparent lapse and proceed to
            advocate my own view. <cite>- Brenda Laurel, “The Six Elements and
            Causal Relations Among Them”</cite></p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Which, should be noted, already inspired
            <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/shebang/2013/03/20/we-are-the-medium-directors-cut/">a previous post</a>.</p>
            
            <p>The particular idea that Laurel was referring to was one first
            explored by Aristotle over 2000 years prior, and I was struck with the
            eerie feeling of being transported into a conversation spanning
            millennia as well as minds. Like Michelangelo chipping away at a block
            of marble to reveal the sculpture hidden within, poets and
            philosophers carve away at the layers of representation in an attempt
            to reveal the essence of a concept encased within.</p>
            
            <p>It occurred to me that the same process is occurring in the sciences
            as well, although usually the bricks of representation<sup id="fnref:david"><a href="#fn:david" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, are
            mathematical symbols rather than linguistic. In a moment of
            serendipity, while I was musing over the conversation of this
            morning’s class, I opened a book on Nonlinear Geometric Control Theory
            that, a few weeks back, I had checked out of the library on a whim. If
            the title means little to you, rest assure, it does me as well. This
            is not a topic I am too familiar with, but for a reason I can not
            fully explain, ever since I was introduced very briefly to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form">differential forms</a>
            in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis">real analysis</a> class
            I suspected that the language of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry">differential
            geometry</a> had the
            potential for elegant representations of optimal control problems. Low
            and behold, I opened this book and immediately saw a paper in which
            the authors, Sussmann and Willems, explored several representations of
            the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Brachistochrone.html">brachistochrone
            problem</a>,
            concluding with a differential-geometric approach that they claimed as
            the most elegant thus far.</p>
            
            <h3 id="the-brachristochrone-problem">The brachristochrone problem</h3>
            
            <p>In 1696,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Bernoulli">Johann Bernoulli</a>
            asked a question that has become a classical problem used as
            motivating example for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations">calculus of variations</a>
            and rears its head again in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control">optimal</a> control<sup id="fnref:lcp"><a href="#fn:lcp" class="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Given two points A and B in a vertical plane, what is the curve
            traced out by a point acted on only by gravity, which starts at A
            and reaches B in the shortest time. <cite>-
            <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Brachistochrone.html">The bracristochrone problem</a></cite></p>

            <p><img src="/assets/posts/Brachistochrone.png" alt="Brachistochrone problem"></p>
            
            <p>The problem itself is older than Bernoulli: Galileo had conducted his
            own exploration in 1638 and incorrectly deduce the solution to be the
            arc of a circle<sup id="fnref:brachristochrone"><a href="#fn:brachristochrone" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Bernoulli’s revitalization of the
            question is what led to the first correct answer, that the solution is
            a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloid">cycloid</a></p>
            
            <p>Sussmann and Willems summarize the various solutions to the problem as
            follows:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <ol>
                <li>Johann Bernoulli’s own solution based on an analogy with
            geometrical optics,</li>
                <li>the solution based on the classical
            calculus of variations,</li>
                <li>the optimal control method, and, finally,  </li>
                <li>the differential-geometric approach</li>
              </ol>
            
              <p><cite>- Sussmann &amp; Willems</cite></p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>[place holder for a more in-depth summary…ran out of time tonight] </p>
            
            <p>They demonstrate how each successive method refines the solution space
            and eliminates unnecessary assumptions to approach what could be
            considered the essence of the problem itself. They end with the
            differential-geometric approach with the claim that it is thus far the
            best at elegantly capturing the problem, but it hardly seems like this
            will be the final word on such a well traveled challenge.</p>
            
            <p>So it seems the path the poet takes in exploring the nature of life is
            not all that dissimilar from the path the mathematician, scientist or
            engineer takes, only the tools differ, and even then, the difference
            is often over stated. They are all just different colors of bricks.</p>
