            <p>In his article
            <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jun/20/internet-everything-need-to-know">The internet: Everything you ever need to know</a>,
            John Naughton lists nine key concepts about the Internet to help us
            understand that profound impact it is having, and will continue to
            have, on our lives. Reading number 3 “DISRUPTION IS A FEATURE, NOT A
            BUG” I found myself drawing parallels to the design of the Internet
            and the design of the Unix operating system. The similarities are no
            accident, as the history of Unix and the Internet became closely
            intertwined after DARPA’s 1980 decisions that the BSD Unix team would
            implement the brand new TCP/IP stack which controls how data packets
            are routed between machines on the Internet.  Of the design of the
            Internet, Naughton says</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>It was based on two axioms. Firstly, there should be no central
             ownership or control – no institution which would decide who could
             join or what the network could be used for. Secondly, the network
             should not be optimised for any particular application. This led to
             the idea of a “simple” network that did only one thing – take in
             data packets at one end and do its best to deliver them to their
             destinations.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The result of this was a general purpose
            network from which sprang a diverse collection of services and
            applications (including the World Wide Web, see item number 2), some
            of which began disrupting established industries. This
            disruption, Naughton argues, is a desirable effect, though not
            necessarily to the existing music labels and media
            distributor behemoths such Warner Music Group and others that are
            having to drastically rethink their business models to remain relevant
            in the era of peer-to-peer data networks. Like the Internet, Unix was
            designed around a number of axioms, the relevant ones being that the
            system should provide a core set of well defined, simple system calls
            for interacting with hardware and data, and that passing data between
            processes should be as easy as possible. As a result of these design
            choices an environment of diverse programs, each of which “do one
            thing and one thing well” and can easily share data with other
            programs has developed. The end result of this can be thought of as a
            direct contrast to this description by Eric Raymond in his book
            <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s05.html">The Art of Unix Programming</a>:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Many operating systems touted as more ‘modern’ or ‘user friendly’
            than Unix achieve their surface glossiness by locking users and
            developers into one interface policy, and offer an
            application-programming interface that for all its elaborateness is
            rather narrow and rigid. On such systems, tasks the designers have
            anticipated are very easy — but tasks they have not anticipated are
            often impossible or at best extremely painful.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Unix users, on the other hand, have consistently been able to
            complete tasks that were never anticipated by the original designers,
            a key factor in its continued relevance.  As technology changes and
            users demand new tools and applications developers on other systems
            have to work a lot harder and are at the mercy of the system
            developers to make changes to the underlying system to continue to
            produce cutting edge software solutions.  On a Unix system it is just
            as easy to copy a file from your USB  flash drive to your hard drive
            as it is to copy a file from your harddrive to a machine on the other
            side of the world and it is just as easy to stream video data from a
            local file as it is from a server on the internet.  The design has
            lead to a remarkable, even surprising degree of flexibility and
            usefulness:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Unix has supported a mind-bogglingly wide spectrum of uses. No other
            operating system has shone simultaneously as a research vehicle, a
            friendly host for technical custom applications, a platform for
            commercial-off-the-shelf business software, and a vital component
            technology of the Internet. <cite>- Eric Raymond, The Art of Unix
            Programming</cite></p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Like the Internet, the simple infrastructure layer by Unix (and its
            present-day incarnations such as BSD and GNU/Linux) provides an
            environment for nearly unlimited creativity, one which continues to
            surprise users and non-users alike with its ability to solve problems
            and implement ideas that a year ago didn’t even exist.  And likewise,
            the disruption it has caused has been a boon to individuals: The Linux
            based Android operating system is running on
            <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2237315">over half the world’s smart phones</a>
            and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system#Market_share">quickly overtoke</a> more
            established contenders such as Apple’s iOS. Linux has already
            disrupted the
            <a href="http://softwareandunicycles.wordpress.com/2010/07/31/does-desktop-linux-need-a-killer-app/">server market, the embedded market and most recently the phone market</a>.  It
            remains to be seen whether or not it will have a noticeable impact on
            Microsoft’s stranglehold on the desktop market, unless you consider
            Apple’s Unix derived OS X as an example.</p>
