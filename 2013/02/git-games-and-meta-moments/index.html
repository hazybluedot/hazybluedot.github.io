            <p>I had a bit of a meta moment while swimming today. I have a lot of good moments while swimming, probably because it’s a chance for my mind to wander. That’s probably a good argument to go more often than I did this past week (1 out of 6 possible practice days!). But I digress.</p>
            
            <p>Yesterday I was introduced to a <a href="http://pcottle.github.com/learnGitBranching/">game of sorts</a> to help learn some concepts used by <a href="http://git-scm.com/about">git</a>. For those of you who don’t know, git is a versioning control system that has gained quit a bit of popularity over the past few years, especially in the open source community. I had been using it myself for my own projects, but mainly at a very simplistic level.</p>
            
            <p>At one level, a versioning control system (VCS), of which git is one of many, is a tool to facilitate documenting the changes of… well, a document. Historically these systems were develped by software designers to both document changes and provide an easy path to revert to older versions of source code. Later, similar concepts were implemented in modern word processors (with limited scope and power due to the restrictive nature, essentially the traditional method of tracking edits from the pen and paper days was ported over to the electronic medium without much change).</p>
            
            <p>One thing that became much more clear to me after trying out the git game was that while providing logical “snapshots” of a project that can be used as a return point if somethign goes astray in the future, git is creating a history of the project, a history that tells a story. But unlike other histories you may be familiar with, the history generated by git can be rewritten to change the past.</p>
            
            <p>What had alluded me up until this point was what motivation one might have to rewrite history. I figured, you make changes, commit them to the project, those changes get recorded, what more would you need? Well, it turns out that with the ability to rewrite history, git makes it incredibly easy to do certain types of edits on your data and allows an author to use git more as a tool for trying out new, possibly risky ideas, or take off on a tangent while always providing a clear path back to a ground point.</p>
            
            <p>The details of what these types of edits are are important, but after I began writing them up I realized I was losing sight of my original reason for writing this post! Luckily, I have been using git to track changes to this document, and created a branch for each of the examples I thought would be useful. I’m going to leave them out of the final document for now, but they exist in my history, and since I will post this project to github, you are free to take a look!</p>
            
            <p>What I thought about while swimming, after the git game helped me understand why rewriting history could be so useful, and how the history itself could be used, was that since I’m using git to manage the files for ECE2524, I could also use it guide future semesters of the course. Every time I add a new set of lecture notes, or add a new assignment, I make a commit to a git repo containing all the files I’ve used so far. That is also recording the order in which topics are introduced to the class, so I’m generating an outline for the semester just by nature of using git for your regular garden variety versioning control.</p>
            
            <p>But I had an hour and a half to occupy my brain while I swam back and forth, so the wheels kept turning. We use git for class, as those of you in it know, because it is an important tool for software development and happens to be a particularly Unix-y tool to boot. The Unix-i-ness of git is something I will leave for discussion in class tomorrow (oh, the suspense!). We use git, but it is a complicated tool to learn, even though what it is doing is quite simple, once you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">grok</a> it, something that doesn’t always happen quickly, and never as quickly as you would like.</p>
            
            <p>But the information tracking ideas from git can be related to the process we go through in class, which can also be related to the discussion on working memory vs. long-term memory we had in <a href="http://gardnercampbell.wetpaint.com/page/vtclis13">vtlci</a>. The process of learning new things involves some experimentation and a lot of data filtering. We have a lot of information available to us, the culmination of which can be thought of as the contents of our “working directory” in git terms. As we individually work through the information and inspect it through our own lens we commit pieces of it to our memory, our repository. Though we’re not actively doing it, there is a log associated with this process. It is not as precise as something stored on a computer, of course, but looking back on the past few days we can recall things like “concept X made a lot more sense to me after I understood hypothesis Y, which became clear after working through exercise Z.”</p>
            
            <p>What if we were more conscious of this process in class, and even made an effort to map it more directly to the concept of using git? For instance, one versioning control concept we’ll start to explore tomorrow is branching and merging.</p>
            
            <p>A branch can be thought of as a temporary deviation away from the main story line. In fact, in my first paragraph I went off on a bit of a tangent about my tendency to let my mind wander while swimming. That could be thought of as a branch away from the main topic, which (I promise) is about using git to map the journey we take to learn to use git. In fact, I switched to a new branch in git when I began writing those sentences, and then merged them back into the main conversation when I was done.</p>
            
            <p>What if the class were split up into groups, and each group worked on one aspect of learning to use git’s branch and merge functionality. For instances, Group 1 might play the git game, while group 2 might read about how git represents and references data and what is going on under the hood. At that point, the collective commit knowledge of the class will have split into two branches. One branch with more of a pragmatic grasp of “this is how I do a branch and merge” and another branch with a better understanding of “this is how a branch and a merge is implemented by git”. Then, the following week, both groups would come back together and share what each learned. The two groups will have just “merged” their knowledge and everyone should have a better understanding of how to conduct a branch and a merge, and also what is going on with the underlying data structure when they do one.</p>
            
            <p>Oh, and by the way, when writing that last paragraph I created two new branches: one named “group1” and it contained the description of what the hypothetical group1 would do, and another called “group2” which contained the sentance describing that group’s task. Then I merged the two back into the master branch, reformated the paragraph and add a summary. Check out this history on github!</p>
            
            <p>So this whole process got me thinking. Does thinkging about meta thoughts make it easier or more likely to think about meta thoughts in the future? And likewise, does it make it easier to draw comparisons between seemingly unrelated processes, such as learning new ideas, and software development, when you have a process and a vocabulary to describe the process of each? <a href="http://bit.ly/YAAQ7a">I am a strange loop</a>.</p>
