              <p>How to go about creating a space that facilitates learning? As we
            learned from Morningstar and Farmer, there is a danger of
            over-designing the space and often the users don’t end up using the
            space in the way the designer intended. So we shouldn’t
            over-design. But there should probably be some kind of structure,
            right? Or why create the space at all? <cite>- my brain</cite></p>

            <p>These are some of the thoughts that were going through my head as I
            set out to plan my final project. Throughout the semester a common
            focus of mine has been the lack of a space in my own field (Electrical
            &amp; Computer Engineering) to facilitate making connections between the
            work that goes on in the department, both teaching and research, and
            the outside world.</p>

            <p>Time is an important dimension to consider when tracing the path of a
            media-represented concept. This is a theme that has stuck with me
            since reading Brenda Laurel’s “The Six Elements and Causal Relations
            Among Them” and coming across this brilliant bit of prose:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>As scholars are wont to do, I will blame the vagaries of
            translation, figurative language, and mutations introduced by
            centuries of interpretation for this apparent lapse and proceed to
            advocate my own view. <cite>- Brenda Laurel, “The Six Elements and
            Causal Relations Among Them”</cite></p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Which, should be noted, already inspired
            <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/shebang/2013/03/20/we-are-the-medium-directors-cut/">a previous post</a>.</p>
            
            <p>The particular idea that Laurel was referring to was one first
            explored by Aristotle over 2000 years prior, and I was struck with the
            eerie feeling of being transported into a conversation spanning
            millennia as well as minds. Like Michelangelo chipping away at a block
            of marble to reveal the sculpture hidden within, poets and
            philosophers carve away at the layers of representation in an attempt
            to reveal the essence of a concept encased within.</p>
            
            <p>It occurred to me that the same process is occurring in the sciences
            as well, although usually the bricks of representation<sup id="fnref:david"><a href="#fn:david" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, are
            mathematical symbols rather than linguistic. In a moment of
            serendipity, while I was musing over the conversation of this
            morning’s class, I opened a book on Nonlinear Geometric Control Theory
            that, a few weeks back, I had checked out of the library on a whim. If
            the title means little to you, rest assure, it does me as well. This
            is not a topic I am too familiar with, but for a reason I can not
            fully explain, ever since I was introduced very briefly to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form">differential forms</a>
            in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis">real analysis</a> class
            I suspected that the language of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry">differential
            geometry</a> had the
            potential for elegant representations of optimal control problems. Low
            and behold, I opened this book and immediately saw a paper in which
            the authors, Sussmann and Willems, explored several representations of
            the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Brachistochrone.html">brachistochrone
            problem</a>,
            concluding with a differential-geometric approach that they claimed as
            the most elegant thus far.</p>

            <p>In 1696,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Bernoulli">Johann Bernoulli</a>
            asked a question that has become a classical problem used as
            motivating example for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations">calculus of variations</a>
            and rears its head again in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control">optimal</a> control<sup id="fnref:lcp"><a href="#fn:lcp" class="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Given two points A and B in a vertical plane, what is the curve
            traced out by a point acted on only by gravity, which starts at A
            and reaches B in the shortest time. <cite>-

            <p><img src="/assets/posts/Brachistochrone.png" alt="Brachistochrone problem"></p>
            
            <p>The problem itself is older than Bernoulli: Galileo had conducted his
            own exploration in 1638 and incorrectly deduce the solution to be the
            arc of a circle<sup id="fnref:brachristochrone"><a href="#fn:brachristochrone" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Bernoulli’s revitalization of the
            question is what led to the first correct answer, that the solution is
            a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloid">cycloid</a></p>
            
            <p>Sussmann and Willems summarize the various solutions to the problem as
            follows:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <ol>
                <li>Johann Bernoulli’s own solution based on an analogy with
            geometrical optics,</li>
                <li>the solution based on the classical
            calculus of variations,</li>
                <li>the optimal control method, and, finally,  </li>
                <li>the differential-geometric approach</li>
              </ol>
            
              <p><cite>- Sussmann &amp; Willems</cite></p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>[place holder for a more in-depth summary…ran out of time tonight] </p>
            
            <p>They demonstrate how each successive method refines the solution space
            and eliminates unnecessary assumptions to approach what could be
            considered the essence of the problem itself. They end with the
            differential-geometric approach with the claim that it is thus far the
            best at elegantly capturing the problem, but it hardly seems like this
            will be the final word on such a well traveled challenge.</p>
            
            <p>So it seems the path the poet takes in exploring the nature of life is
            not all that dissimilar from the path the mathematician, scientist or
            engineer takes, only the tools differ, and even then, the difference
            is often over stated. They are all just different colors of bricks.</p>

          </h1>
          <aside>Posted at: April 9, 2013</aside>
          <article>
            <p>Why would I want to eliminate the course that I’ve been teaching the
            past four semesters, that I have put so many hours into to update
            content, create new assignments, written (and re-written each
            semester… another topic altogether) a set of scripts to facilitate
            reviewing stacks of programming assignments and generally had a great
            time with?</p>
            
            <p>Well, because I don’t think it should be a separate course to begin
            with. As many have noted, and I have agreed, ECE2524 in many respects
            is a kind of a “catch-all” course for all those really important
            topics and tools (version control, anyone?) that just don’t get
            covered anywhere else. It is also officially (but not rigorously
            enforced in the form of a prereq) to be an introduction to more
            advanced software engineering courses, so it has the general feel of a
            programming course.</p>
            
            <p>I think programming (and *nix OS usage and philosophy) is too
            important to delegate off to a 2 credit course and treat separately
            from the rest of the engineering curriculum, an idea that was
            solidified after reading an excerpt from Mindstorms by Seymour Papert.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>I began to see how children who had learned to program computers
            could use very concrete computer models to think about thinking and
            to learn about learning and in doing so, enhance their powers as
            psychologists and as epistemologists.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Papert is a strong advocate to introducing computer programming to
            children at an early age and using it as a tool to learn other
            disciplines</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>The metaphor of computer as mathematics-speaking entity puts the
            learner in a qualitatively new kind of relationship to an important
            domain of knowledge. Even the best of educational television is
            limited to offering quantitative improvements in the kinds of
            learning that existed without it… By contrast, when a child learns to
            program, the process of learning is transformed. It becomes more
            active and self-directed. In particular, the knowledge is acquired
            for a recognizable personal purpose.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>It goes without saying that a solid understanding of math is crucial
            for any of the STEM fields, but computers and programming can also
            encourage engagement with
            <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2013/04/combining-robotics-with-poetry-art-and-engineering-can-co-exist/">other fields as well</a>,
            though that is not the focus of this post.</p>
            
            <p>Along with being a useful skill to have, programming teaches a
            systematic way of thinking about a problem, and crucially shifts the
            model of learning from one that embodies a “got it” and “got it wrong”
            binary state to one that encourages the question “how do I fix
            it?”. As Papert notes, and I can personally attest, when writing a
            program you never get it right the first time. Becoming a good
            programmer means becoming an expert at tracking down and fixing bugs.</p>

            <p>Some strong arguments for the symbiosis of programming and learning
            valuable thinking skills at an early age. But the benefits don’t
            disappear at the college level, especially in a field such as
            engineering in which learning programming for the sake of programming
            is a valuable skill (there are several required classes on the
            subject, so you know it must be important. Slight sarcasm, but it’s
            true, regardless of how cynical we agree to be about the way classes
            are structured and the curriculum is built for us). If programming can
            help engage with learning mathematics, and as a side effect get us
            thinking about how we think, and shift our view of learning to a more
            constructive one, then can’t we get at least the same positive affects
            if we apply it to more advanced concepts and ideas? It doesn’t hurt
            that a good chunk of engineering is mathematics anyway.</p>
            
            <p>The wheels really started turning after the first day of
            guest-lecturing for Signals &amp; Systems. Here’s a course that is a lot
            of math, but critically foundational for learning how to learn about
            how the world works. That may seem a little embellished, especially
            for those not familiar with the field (Signals &amp; Systems crash course:
            a system is anything that has an input signal and produces and output
            signal, e.g. a car (input is gas/break, output is speed), a heart beat
            (input is electrical signal transmitted along nerves, output is muscle
            contraction or blood flow), the planet (so many systems, but treating
            atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other gases as an input and the
            average global temperature would be one example of a system we would
            be interested in studying)). Signals &amp; Systems provides a set of tools
            for exploring the input/output relationships of… anything.</p>
            
            <p>So why is it taught from a set of slides?</p>
            
            <p>What better way to really engage with and understand the theory than
            USE it? Now most educational budgets wouldn’t be able to cover the
            costs if everyone wanted to learn the input/output behavior of their
            own personal communications satellite, but the beauty of Signals &amp;
            Systems, and the mathematical representations that it embodies, is
            that everything can be simulated on a computer. From the velocity of a
            car, to blood flow caused by a beating heart, to the motion of the
            planets and beyond.</p>
            
            <p>I envision a Signals &amp; Systems course that is mostly
            programming. People will argue that the programming aspect of the
            material is just the “practical implementation”, and while that’s
            important, the theory is critical. Yes, the theory is what helps us
            develop a generalized insight into different ways of representing
            different types of systems and what allows us to do a good deal of
            design in a simulated environment with greatly reduced risks,
            especially when say, designing new flight controls for a commercial
            jet.</p>
            
            <p>But I think the theory can be taught alongside the programming for a
            much richer experience than is obtained by following a set of
            slides. You want to understand how the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform">Laplace transform</a>
            works? What better way than to implement it on a computer. I guarantee
            you, if you have to write a program that calculates the Laplace
            transform for an arbitrary input signal, by the time you’re done with
            the debugging, you’re going to have a pretty good understanding of
            whats going on, not to mention a slew of other important experiences
            (how do you solve an integral on a computer anyway?).</p>
            
            <p>Talking about the differences between continuous time systems and
            discrete time systems is taken to a whole new level when you start
            trying to simulate a continues-time system on a computer, very much a
            discrete-time system. How do you even do that? Is it sufficient to
            just use a really really small time step?</p>
            
            <p>So yes, I think the best case scenario would be one in which ECE2524:
            Intro to Unix for Engineers is obsolete<sup id="fnref:focus"><a href="#fn:focus" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Not because the topics we
            cover are unimportant, quite the contrary, they are so important that
            they should be providing a framework for learning engineering.</p>

                  <p>I’ve focused primarily on the programming aspect of ECE2524
            here, but those of you who know me and have taken the course with
            me know that the Unix philosophy is a big part of it as
            well. Integrating the programming aspects into other coursework
            would of course not address that. I’m sure, with a little thought
            we all can think up a clever way of introducing the *nix
            philosophy and generally the whole concept of thinking about a
            philosophy when thinking about engineering, and what that even
            means, with every other course. Because well, it should be an
            integral part of everything else we learn.<a href="#fnref:focus" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>
