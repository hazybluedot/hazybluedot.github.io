            <p>For the past two years I have been using Virginia Tech’s
            <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/">Blogs@VT</a> service to host my blog. It’s
            been nice and all, but my goal had always been to move away from the
            VT hosted option and away from <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>
            too. It’s not that I don’t appreciate all that Blogs@VT or WordPress
            has done: I think Blogs@VT is an excellent service providing
            easy-access blog hosting to the Virginia Tech community (though they
            really should fix whatever is making
            <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/support/2012/11/27/faq-i-cant-access-or-feed-out-my-posts-by-category/">this hack</a>
            necessary to get tag feeds), and WordPress is fine for what it does,

              <p>How to go about creating a space that facilitates learning? As we
            learned from Morningstar and Farmer, there is a danger of
            over-designing the space and often the users don’t end up using the
            space in the way the designer intended. So we shouldn’t
            over-design. But there should probably be some kind of structure,
            right? Or why create the space at all? <cite>- my brain</cite></p>

            <p>These are some of the thoughts that were going through my head as I
            set out to plan my final project. Throughout the semester a common
            focus of mine has been the lack of a space in my own field (Electrical
            &amp; Computer Engineering) to facilitate making connections between the
            work that goes on in the department, both teaching and research, and
            the outside world.</p>

            <p>There have <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/leonp/2013/05/08/here-comes-linux/">been</a> a <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/hussaino/2013/05/15/linux-dominating-space/">couple</a> of blog posts recently referencing the recent switch <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> made from Windows to <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian 6</a>, a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU/Linux</a> distribution, as the OS running on the laptops abord the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html">International Space Station</a>. It’s worth noting that Linux is no stranger to the ISS, as it has been a part of ground control operations <a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/w3/issue/12/Linux_on_the_International_Space_Station.pdf%20">since the beginning</a>.</p>
            
            <p>The reasons for the space-side switch <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/to-the-space-station-and-beyond-with-linux-7000014958/">are quoted</a> as</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>…we needed an operating system that was stable and reliable – one
            that would give us in-house control. So if we needed to patch,
            adjust, or adapt, we could.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This is satisfying to many Open Source/Linux fans in its own right: a
            collaborative open source project has
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">once again</a> proved itself more
            stable and reliable for the (relatively) extrodinary conditions of low
            Earth orbit than a product produced by a major software giant. Plus
            one for open source collaboration and peer networks!</p>

            <p>I’ve been meaning to post something about the interesting interactions between the unix commands <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/6/fortune">fortune</a> and <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/cowsay">cowsay</a>. This is not that post. Long story short, fortune prints a random tidbit to the terminal and cowsay takes an input string and draws an ASCII art cow with a speech bubble containing the text you sent to the command. In addition, there are a number of different “cows” that can be drawn and so when pairing up random fortunes and random cows can be a parataxis gold mine. Here’s the command I have in my bash login script that does just that: </p>
            
            <pre><code class="language-bash">fortune -s | cowsay -f <span class="k">$(</span> find /usr/share/cows -name <span class="s1">'*.cow'</span> | shuf | head -n 1 <span class="k">)</span></code></pre>
            
            <p>More on that in the “real” post, but for now, I couldn’t pass this up which popped up when I opened a new terminal window just now:</p>
            
            <pre class="text"><code>  _________________________________&#x000A;     / "The medium is the message." -- \&#x000A;     \ Marshall McLuhan                /&#x000A;      ---------------------------------&#x000A;            \   \_______&#x000A;      v__v   \  \   O   )&#x000A;      (oo)      ||----w |&#x000A;      (__)      ||     ||  \/\&#x000A;    &#x000A;    </code></pre>

            <p>Time is an important dimension to consider when tracing the path of a
            media-represented concept. This is a theme that has stuck with me
            since reading Brenda Laurel’s “The Six Elements and Causal Relations
            Among Them” and coming across this brilliant bit of prose:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>As scholars are wont to do, I will blame the vagaries of
            translation, figurative language, and mutations introduced by
            centuries of interpretation for this apparent lapse and proceed to
            advocate my own view. <cite>- Brenda Laurel, “The Six Elements and
            Causal Relations Among Them”</cite></p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Which, should be noted, already inspired
            <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/shebang/2013/03/20/we-are-the-medium-directors-cut/">a previous post</a>.</p>
            
            <p>The particular idea that Laurel was referring to was one first
            explored by Aristotle over 2000 years prior, and I was struck with the
            eerie feeling of being transported into a conversation spanning
            millennia as well as minds. Like Michelangelo chipping away at a block
            of marble to reveal the sculpture hidden within, poets and
            philosophers carve away at the layers of representation in an attempt
            to reveal the essence of a concept encased within.</p>

            <p>Why would I want to eliminate the course that I’ve been teaching the
            past four semesters, that I have put so many hours into to update
            content, create new assignments, written (and re-written each
            semester… another topic altogether) a set of scripts to facilitate
            reviewing stacks of programming assignments and generally had a great
            time with?</p>
            
            <p>Well, because I don’t think it should be a separate course to begin
            with. As many have noted, and I have agreed, ECE2524 in many respects
            is a kind of a “catch-all” course for all those really important
            topics and tools (version control, anyone?) that just don’t get
            covered anywhere else. It is also officially (but not rigorously
            enforced in the form of a prereq) to be an introduction to more
            advanced software engineering courses, so it has the general feel of a
            programming course.</p>

            <p>In his article
            <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jun/20/internet-everything-need-to-know">The internet: Everything you ever need to know</a>,
            John Naughton lists nine key concepts about the Internet to help us
            understand that profound impact it is having, and will continue to
            have, on our lives. Reading number 3 “DISRUPTION IS A FEATURE, NOT A
            BUG” I found myself drawing parallels to the design of the Internet
            and the design of the Unix operating system. The similarities are no
            accident, as the history of Unix and the Internet became closely
            intertwined after DARPA’s 1980 decisions that the BSD Unix team would
            implement the brand new TCP/IP stack which controls how data packets
            are routed between machines on the Internet.  Of the design of the
            Internet, Naughton says</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>It was based on two axioms. Firstly, there should be no central
             ownership or control – no institution which would decide who could
             join or what the network could be used for. Secondly, the network
             should not be optimised for any particular application. This led to
             the idea of a “simple” network that did only one thing – take in
             data packets at one end and do its best to deliver them to their
             destinations.</p>
