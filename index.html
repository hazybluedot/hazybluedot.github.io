              <p>How to go about creating a space that facilitates learning? As we
            learned from Morningstar and Farmer, there is a danger of
            over-designing the space and often the users don’t end up using the
            space in the way the designer intended. So we shouldn’t
            over-design. But there should probably be some kind of structure,
            right? Or why create the space at all? <cite>- my brain</cite></p>

            <p>These are some of the thoughts that were going through my head as I
            set out to plan my final project. Throughout the semester a common
            focus of mine has been the lack of a space in my own field (Electrical
            &amp; Computer Engineering) to facilitate making connections between the
            work that goes on in the department, both teaching and research, and
            the outside world.</p>

            <p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="584" height="329" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mission_pages/station/main/index.html).%20It's%20worth%20noting%20that%20Linux%20is%20no%20stranger%20to%20the%20ISS,%20as%20it%20has%20been%20a%20part%20of%20ground%20control%20operations%20%5Bsince%20the%20beginning%5D(http://www.linux-magazine.com/w3/issue/12/Linux_on_the_International_Space_Station.pdf%20).%0A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
            <p>The reasons for the space-side switch <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/to-the-space-station-and-beyond-with-linux-7000014958/">are quoted</a> as</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>…we needed an operating system that was stable and reliable – one
            that would give us in-house control. So if we needed to patch,
            adjust, or adapt, we could.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This is satisfying to many Open Source/Linux fans in its own right: a
            collaborative open source project has
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">once again</a> proved itself more
            stable and reliable for the (relatively) extrodinary conditions of low
            Earth orbit than a product produced by a major software giant. Plus
            one for open source collaboration and peer networks!</p>
            
            <p>But there’s another reason to be excited. And it’s a reason that would
            not necessarily apply</p>
            <p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="584" height="329" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7XTHdcmjenI#t=9m08s))%20to,%0A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
            <p>say, Apple fanatics had NASA decided to switch to OS X instead of
            Debian. And that reason has to do with the collaborative nature of the
            open source movement, codified in many open source licenses under
            which the software is released. Linux, and the GNU tools, which
            together make up a fully functional operating system, are released
            under the
            <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>. Unlike
            many licenses used for commersial software, the GPL esures that
            software licenses under its terms remains free for users to use,modify
            and redistribute. There are certainly some strong criticisms and
            <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/roumen/entry/sun_s_criticism_of_gpl">ongoing debate</a>
            regarding some key aspects of the GPL, especially
            <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19133/Torvalds_Still_Will_Not_License_Linux_Under_GPL_v3/">version 3</a>,
            the point of contention mostly lies in what is popularly called the
            “viral” effect of the license: that modified and derived work must
            also be released under the same license. The GPL might not be
            appropriate for every developer and every project, but it embodies the
            spirit of open source software in a way that is agreeable with many
            developers and users.</p>
            
            <p>So what does this all mean in terms of NASA’s move? We already know
            that they chose GNU/Linux for its reliability and stability over
            alternatives, but that doesn’t mean it’s completely bug free, or will
            always work perfectly with every piece of hardware, which after all is
            another reason for the switch: no OS will be completely bug free or
            always work with all hardware, but at least Debian gives NASA the
            flexibility of making improvements themselves. And there in lies the
            reason for excitement. While there is no requirement that NASA
            redistribute their own modified versions of the software, there is no
            reason to assume they wouldn’t in most cases, and if they do, it will
            be redistributed under the same license. It’s certainly realistic to
            expect they will be directing a lot of attention to making the Linux
            kernel, and the GNU tools packaged with Debian even more stable and
            more reliable, and those improvements will make their way back into
            the general distributions that we all use. This means better hardware
            support for all GNU/Linux users in the future!</p>
            
            <p>And of course it works both ways. Any bug fixes you make and
            redistribute may make their way back to the ISS, transforming
            humanity’s thirst for exploring “the final frontier” into a truly
            collaborative and global endeavor.</p>

          <article>
            <p>Time is an important dimension to consider when tracing the path of a
            media-represented concept. This is a theme that has stuck with me
            since reading Brenda Laurel’s “The Six Elements and Causal Relations
            Among Them” and coming across this brilliant bit of prose:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>As scholars are wont to do, I will blame the vagaries of
            translation, figurative language, and mutations introduced by
            centuries of interpretation for this apparent lapse and proceed to
            advocate my own view. <cite>- Brenda Laurel, “The Six Elements and
            Causal Relations Among Them”</cite></p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Which, should be noted, already inspired
            <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/shebang/2013/03/20/we-are-the-medium-directors-cut/">a previous post</a>.</p>
            
            <p>The particular idea that Laurel was referring to was one first
            explored by Aristotle over 2000 years prior, and I was struck with the
            eerie feeling of being transported into a conversation spanning
            millennia as well as minds. Like Michelangelo chipping away at a block
            of marble to reveal the sculpture hidden within, poets and
            philosophers carve away at the layers of representation in an attempt
            to reveal the essence of a concept encased within.</p>
            
            <p>It occurred to me that the same process is occurring in the sciences
            as well, although usually the bricks of representation<sup id="fnref:david"><a href="#fn:david" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, are
            mathematical symbols rather than linguistic. In a moment of
            serendipity, while I was musing over the conversation of this
            morning’s class, I opened a book on Nonlinear Geometric Control Theory
            that, a few weeks back, I had checked out of the library on a whim. If
            the title means little to you, rest assure, it does me as well. This
            is not a topic I am too familiar with, but for a reason I can not
            fully explain, ever since I was introduced very briefly to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form">differential forms</a>
            in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis">real analysis</a> class
            I suspected that the language of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry">differential
            geometry</a> had the
            potential for elegant representations of optimal control problems. Low
            and behold, I opened this book and immediately saw a paper in which
            the authors, Sussmann and Willems, explored several representations of
            the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Brachistochrone.html">brachistochrone
            problem</a>,
            concluding with a differential-geometric approach that they claimed as
            the most elegant thus far.</p>
            
            <h3 id="the-brachristochrone-problem">The brachristochrone problem</h3>
            
            <p>In 1696,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Bernoulli">Johann Bernoulli</a>
            asked a question that has become a classical problem used as
            motivating example for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations">calculus of variations</a>
            and rears its head again in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control">optimal</a> control<sup id="fnref:lcp"><a href="#fn:lcp" class="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Given two points A and B in a vertical plane, what is the curve
            traced out by a point acted on only by gravity, which starts at A
            and reaches B in the shortest time. <cite>-

            <p>The problem itself is older than Bernoulli: Galileo had conducted his
            own exploration in 1638 and incorrectly deduce the solution to be the
            arc of a circle<sup id="fnref:brachristochrone"><a href="#fn:brachristochrone" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Bernoulli’s revitalization of the
            question is what led to the first correct answer, that the solution is
            a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloid">cycloid</a></p>
            
            <p>Sussmann and Willems summarize the various solutions to the problem as
            follows:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <ol>
                <li>Johann Bernoulli’s own solution based on an analogy with
            geometrical optics,</li>
                <li>the solution based on the classical
            calculus of variations,</li>
                <li>the optimal control method, and, finally,  </li>
                <li>the differential-geometric approach</li>
              </ol>
            
              <p><cite>- Sussmann &amp; Willems</cite></p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>[place holder for a more in-depth summary…ran out of time tonight] </p>
            
            <p>They demonstrate how each successive method refines the solution space
            and eliminates unnecessary assumptions to approach what could be
            considered the essence of the problem itself. They end with the
            differential-geometric approach with the claim that it is thus far the
            best at elegantly capturing the problem, but it hardly seems like this
            will be the final word on such a well traveled challenge.</p>
            
            <p>So it seems the path the poet takes in exploring the nature of life is
            not all that dissimilar from the path the mathematician, scientist or
            engineer takes, only the tools differ, and even then, the difference
            is often over stated. They are all just different colors of bricks.</p>

          </h1>
          <aside>Posted at: April 9, 2013</aside>
          <article>
            <p>Why would I want to eliminate the course that I’ve been teaching the
            past four semesters, that I have put so many hours into to update
            content, create new assignments, written (and re-written each
            semester… another topic altogether) a set of scripts to facilitate
            reviewing stacks of programming assignments and generally had a great
            time with?</p>
            
            <p>Well, because I don’t think it should be a separate course to begin
            with. As many have noted, and I have agreed, ECE2524 in many respects
            is a kind of a “catch-all” course for all those really important
            topics and tools (version control, anyone?) that just don’t get
            covered anywhere else. It is also officially (but not rigorously
            enforced in the form of a prereq) to be an introduction to more
            advanced software engineering courses, so it has the general feel of a
            programming course.</p>
            
            <p>I think programming (and *nix OS usage and philosophy) is too
            important to delegate off to a 2 credit course and treat separately
            from the rest of the engineering curriculum, an idea that was
            solidified after reading an excerpt from Mindstorms by Seymour Papert.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>I began to see how children who had learned to program computers
            could use very concrete computer models to think about thinking and
            to learn about learning and in doing so, enhance their powers as
            psychologists and as epistemologists.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Papert is a strong advocate to introducing computer programming to
            children at an early age and using it as a tool to learn other
            disciplines</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>The metaphor of computer as mathematics-speaking entity puts the
            learner in a qualitatively new kind of relationship to an important
            domain of knowledge. Even the best of educational television is
            limited to offering quantitative improvements in the kinds of
            learning that existed without it… By contrast, when a child learns to
            program, the process of learning is transformed. It becomes more
            active and self-directed. In particular, the knowledge is acquired
            for a recognizable personal purpose.</p>

            <p>It goes without saying that a solid understanding of math is crucial
            for any of the STEM fields, but computers and programming can also
            encourage engagement with
            <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2013/04/combining-robotics-with-poetry-art-and-engineering-can-co-exist/">other fields as well</a>,
            though that is not the focus of this post.</p>
            
            <p>Along with being a useful skill to have, programming teaches a
            systematic way of thinking about a problem, and crucially shifts the
            model of learning from one that embodies a “got it” and “got it wrong”
            binary state to one that encourages the question “how do I fix
            it?”. As Papert notes, and I can personally attest, when writing a
            program you never get it right the first time. Becoming a good
            programmer means becoming an expert at tracking down and fixing bugs.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>If this way of looking at intellectual products were generalized to
            how the larger culture thinks about knowledge and its acquisition,
            we all might be less intimidated by our fears of “being wrong.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Some strong arguments for the symbiosis of programming and learning
            valuable thinking skills at an early age. But the benefits don’t
            disappear at the college level, especially in a field such as
            engineering in which learning programming for the sake of programming
            is a valuable skill (there are several required classes on the
            subject, so you know it must be important. Slight sarcasm, but it’s
            true, regardless of how cynical we agree to be about the way classes
            are structured and the curriculum is built for us). If programming can
            help engage with learning mathematics, and as a side effect get us
            thinking about how we think, and shift our view of learning to a more
            constructive one, then can’t we get at least the same positive affects
            if we apply it to more advanced concepts and ideas? It doesn’t hurt
            that a good chunk of engineering is mathematics anyway.</p>
            
            <p>The wheels really started turning after the first day of
            guest-lecturing for Signals &amp; Systems. Here’s a course that is a lot
            of math, but critically foundational for learning how to learn about
            how the world works. That may seem a little embellished, especially
            for those not familiar with the field (Signals &amp; Systems crash course:
            a system is anything that has an input signal and produces and output
            signal, e.g. a car (input is gas/break, output is speed), a heart beat
            (input is electrical signal transmitted along nerves, output is muscle
            contraction or blood flow), the planet (so many systems, but treating
            atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other gases as an input and the
            average global temperature would be one example of a system we would
            be interested in studying)). Signals &amp; Systems provides a set of tools
            for exploring the input/output relationships of… anything.</p>
            
            <p>So why is it taught from a set of slides?</p>
            
            <p>What better way to really engage with and understand the theory than
            USE it? Now most educational budgets wouldn’t be able to cover the
            costs if everyone wanted to learn the input/output behavior of their
            own personal communications satellite, but the beauty of Signals &amp;
            Systems, and the mathematical representations that it embodies, is
            that everything can be simulated on a computer. From the velocity of a
            car, to blood flow caused by a beating heart, to the motion of the
            planets and beyond.</p>
            
            <p>I envision a Signals &amp; Systems course that is mostly
            programming. People will argue that the programming aspect of the
            material is just the “practical implementation”, and while that’s
            important, the theory is critical. Yes, the theory is what helps us
            develop a generalized insight into different ways of representing
            different types of systems and what allows us to do a good deal of
            design in a simulated environment with greatly reduced risks,
            especially when say, designing new flight controls for a commercial
            jet.</p>
            
            <p>But I think the theory can be taught alongside the programming for a
            much richer experience than is obtained by following a set of
            slides. You want to understand how the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform">Laplace transform</a>
            works? What better way than to implement it on a computer. I guarantee
            you, if you have to write a program that calculates the Laplace
            transform for an arbitrary input signal, by the time you’re done with
            the debugging, you’re going to have a pretty good understanding of
            whats going on, not to mention a slew of other important experiences
            (how do you solve an integral on a computer anyway?).</p>
            
            <p>Talking about the differences between continuous time systems and
            discrete time systems is taken to a whole new level when you start
            trying to simulate a continues-time system on a computer, very much a
            discrete-time system. How do you even do that? Is it sufficient to
            just use a really really small time step?</p>
            
            <p>So yes, I think the best case scenario would be one in which ECE2524:
            Intro to Unix for Engineers is obsolete<sup id="fnref:focus"><a href="#fn:focus" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Not because the topics we
            cover are unimportant, quite the contrary, they are so important that
            they should be providing a framework for learning engineering.</p>

                  <p>I’ve focused primarily on the programming aspect of ECE2524

            me know that the Unix philosophy is a big part of it as
            well. Integrating the programming aspects into other coursework
            would of course not address that. I’m sure, with a little thought
            we all can think up a clever way of introducing the *nix
            philosophy and generally the whole concept of thinking about a
            philosophy when thinking about engineering, and what that even
            means, with every other course. Because well, it should be an

          </h1>
          <aside>Posted at: January 28, 2013</aside>
          <article>
            <p>In his article
            <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jun/20/internet-everything-need-to-know">The internet: Everything you ever need to know</a>,
            John Naughton lists nine key concepts about the Internet to help us
            understand that profound impact it is having, and will continue to
            have, on our lives. Reading number 3 “DISRUPTION IS A FEATURE, NOT A
            BUG” I found myself drawing parallels to the design of the Internet
            and the design of the Unix operating system. The similarities are no
            accident, as the history of Unix and the Internet became closely
            intertwined after DARPA’s 1980 decisions that the BSD Unix team would
            implement the brand new TCP/IP stack which controls how data packets
            are routed between machines on the Internet.  Of the design of the
            Internet, Naughton says</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>It was based on two axioms. Firstly, there should be no central
             ownership or control – no institution which would decide who could
             join or what the network could be used for. Secondly, the network
             should not be optimised for any particular application. This led to
             the idea of a “simple” network that did only one thing – take in
             data packets at one end and do its best to deliver them to their
             destinations.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The result of this was a general purpose
            network from which sprang a diverse collection of services and
            applications (including the World Wide Web, see item number 2), some
            of which began disrupting established industries. This
            disruption, Naughton argues, is a desirable effect, though not
            necessarily to the existing music labels and media
            distributor behemoths such Warner Music Group and others that are
            having to drastically rethink their business models to remain relevant
            in the era of peer-to-peer data networks. Like the Internet, Unix was
            designed around a number of axioms, the relevant ones being that the
            system should provide a core set of well defined, simple system calls
            for interacting with hardware and data, and that passing data between
            processes should be as easy as possible. As a result of these design
            choices an environment of diverse programs, each of which “do one
            thing and one thing well” and can easily share data with other
            programs has developed. The end result of this can be thought of as a
            direct contrast to this description by Eric Raymond in his book
            <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s05.html">The Art of Unix Programming</a>:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Many operating systems touted as more ‘modern’ or ‘user friendly’
            than Unix achieve their surface glossiness by locking users and
            developers into one interface policy, and offer an
            application-programming interface that for all its elaborateness is
            rather narrow and rigid. On such systems, tasks the designers have
            anticipated are very easy — but tasks they have not anticipated are
            often impossible or at best extremely painful.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Unix users, on the other hand, have consistently been able to
            complete tasks that were never anticipated by the original designers,
            a key factor in its continued relevance.  As technology changes and
            users demand new tools and applications developers on other systems
            have to work a lot harder and are at the mercy of the system
            developers to make changes to the underlying system to continue to
            produce cutting edge software solutions.  On a Unix system it is just
            as easy to copy a file from your USB  flash drive to your hard drive
            as it is to copy a file from your harddrive to a machine on the other
            side of the world and it is just as easy to stream video data from a
            local file as it is from a server on the internet.  The design has
            lead to a remarkable, even surprising degree of flexibility and
            usefulness:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Unix has supported a mind-bogglingly wide spectrum of uses. No other
            operating system has shone simultaneously as a research vehicle, a
            friendly host for technical custom applications, a platform for
            commercial-off-the-shelf business software, and a vital component
            technology of the Internet. <cite>- Eric Raymond, The Art of Unix
            Programming</cite></p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Like the Internet, the simple infrastructure layer by Unix (and its
            present-day incarnations such as BSD and GNU/Linux) provides an
            environment for nearly unlimited creativity, one which continues to
            surprise users and non-users alike with its ability to solve problems
            and implement ideas that a year ago didn’t even exist.  And likewise,
            the disruption it has caused has been a boon to individuals: The Linux
            based Android operating system is running on
            <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2237315">over half the world’s smart phones</a>
            and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system#Market_share">quickly overtoke</a> more
            established contenders such as Apple’s iOS. Linux has already
            disrupted the
            <a href="http://softwareandunicycles.wordpress.com/2010/07/31/does-desktop-linux-need-a-killer-app/">server market, the embedded market and most recently the phone market</a>.  It
            remains to be seen whether or not it will have a noticeable impact on
            Microsoft’s stranglehold on the desktop market, unless you consider
            Apple’s Unix derived OS X as an example.</p>
