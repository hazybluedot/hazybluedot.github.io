Now certainly, the way our information is organized and the way we search for it does change the way we think about information, I think that was one of the key points in [Carr's article](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/).  However, changing the way we think in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing, and it is in fact a continuous process that has been a reality since we were able to stand upright freeing our hands for tasks other than mobility. To be clear, I am not suggesting we give Google (or any other organization that deals with our information) _carte blanche_when it comes to the handling of the world's information.  However, it is important to keep in mind that while information is a component of knowledge, information alone does not define knowledge.  The fear that the standardization and systematization of tasks will turn humans into mindless automatons is certainly something to think about and there is plenty of evidence from the Industrial Revolution that that is indeed the case.  However, the same economic forces that favor standardizing and systematization of a task also favor replacing a human automaton with a robot designed to complete that task.  Of course, currently we are facing a new problem as a result: how do we employ all these people who's jobs have been replaced with robots" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;</p>
